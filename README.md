# Batch Scripts Repository

Welcome to my personal collection of **Batch Scripts**, designed for various tasks, automation, and system tweaks. This repository serves as a platform to showcase some of my **personal projects** while expanding into a larger **toolbox** of **command-line utilities**. Currently in development, the repository will grow with more scripts to automate system administration, simplify tedious workflows, and provide solutions to common problems, all through the elegance of **batch scripting**.

### ‚ö° What's Inside

As of now, this repository contains two batch scripts that offer solutions for:

- **Script 1:** (disk_cleanup.bat)
- **Script 2:** (backup_script.bat)
- **Script 3:** (organize_files.bat)

These scripts demonstrate my focus on creating **efficient**, **minimalistic**, and **reliable** solutions, designed for quick integration into any system setup. They will serve as the foundation for more advanced tools that will be added to the repository in the future.

### üîß Tools Used

- **Batch Script**: Power of the Windows Command Prompt to perform tasks without a GUI interface.
- **CMD/PowerShell**: Essential tools to script the Windows environment for automation.
- **Regex**: Employed for pattern matching and text parsing when required.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with these scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gxdsins/batch.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder where the scripts are located:
    ```bash
    cd batch
    ```
3. Review the available scripts and their purpose.
4. Execute the scripts by running them from the command line:
    ```bash
    script_name.bat
    ```
    
Make sure to review and modify the scripts based on your local setup, especially for environment-specific configurations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Minimal Setup**: No need for complex installations or dependencies. Simply **run and execute**.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Tested with Windows environments.
- **Extensibility**: The scripts can be easily expanded to accommodate new requirements or integrate with other tools.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error catching mechanisms have been incorporated to ensure the scripts run smoothly in most scenarios.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How To Contribute

Since this repository is a work in progress, **contributions** are welcome. Whether you have ideas for improving existing scripts, or new batch script ideas for specific tasks, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request to the main branch.

### üåê License

This repository is **open source** and follows the **MIT License**. Feel free to use and modify the scripts under the conditions outlined in the license.

### Notes:

- **Advanced Techniques**: As I build this collection, expect the use of more advanced batch scripting techniques such as **file redirection**, **error level checking**, and **networking scripts** that automate more sophisticated tasks.
- **Security Considerations**: All scripts are written with minimal risk. Always review batch scripts for security before running them in production environments.

### üî• Current Roadmap

- Expanding the collection with more scripts for system administrators, automation enthusiasts, and power users.
- Integration with **PowerShell** for more complex automation scenarios.
- Community-driven contributions and suggestions are encouraged to enhance functionality and efficiency.
